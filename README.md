## Contributing
This code was provided by Udacity, to complete the project in the Front-End Nanodegree. 

## Aknowlegments

I learned many things with this project, and for me it's more easier than the memory game, since I decided to complete this project right before I finished the memory game, so I remembered how I do make things work. Although I'm not complete the game, missing a few details. But I want to add those things a soon as possible.
